# Projections

This subpackage contains projections that allow any other modules to be used in some projected space. This has multiple uses, one is to save memory by projecting into a smaller subspace, another is splitting parameters into smaller blocks or merging them into a single vector. This can also do things like optimize in fourier domain.
